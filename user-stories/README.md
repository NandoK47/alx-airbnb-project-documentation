# User Stories

This directory contains the **user stories** for the ALX Airbnb Project Documentation.

## Purpose
User stories translate the **use case diagram interactions** into simple, clear descriptions of what users (guests, hosts, and admins) want to achieve within the system.  

They help guide the development process by ensuring that every feature is designed with the end-user in mind.

## Contents
- `user-stories.md` â†’ Core user stories based on the use case diagram (registration, login, property listing, booking, payments, etc.).
