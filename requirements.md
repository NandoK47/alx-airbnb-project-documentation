## 1. User Authentication & Authorization

### Objective

### Functional Requirements  
- Users can **register** with email, password, and full name.  
- Users can **log in** with email and password.  
- Passwords must be securely hashed before storage.  
- JWT (JSON Web Token) will be used for authentication.  
- Sessions expire after a set duration (e.g., 1 hour).  
- Unauthorized requests must return a `401 Unauthorized`.  

### API Endpoints  
- **POST /api/v1/auth/register**  
  - Input: `{ "email": "string", "password": "string", "full_name": "string" }`  
  - Output: `{ "id": "uuid", "email": "string", "token": "jwt_token" }`  
  - Validation:  
    - Email must be unique and valid format.  
    - Password must be â‰¥ 8 characters, contain at least one number & special character.

  - Validation:  
    - Email must exist.  
    - Password must match hash.  

- **GET /api/v1/auth/profile** (Protected)  
  - Input: JWT token in header.  
  - Output: `{ "id": "uuid", "email": "string", "full_name": "string", "role": "user|admin" }`  

### Performance Criteria  
- Authentication requests should respond within **<200ms** under normal load.

      "images": ["string"]
    }
    ```

  - Output: Updated property object.  

- **DELETE /api/v1/properties/{id}** (Protected - Owner)  
  - Output: `{ "message": "Property deleted successfully" }`  

### Performance Criteria

## 3. Booking System

### Objective  
Allow users to book available properties for specific dates.  

### Functional Requirements  
- Users can create bookings by selecting property and date range.

- Users can cancel their bookings within allowed cancellation window (configurable).  

### API Endpoints  
- **POST /api/v1/bookings** (Protected - User)

    {
      "property_id": "uuid",
      "check_in": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "check_out": "YYYY-MM-DD"
    }
    ```  
  - Output:  
    `{ "id": "uuid", "property_id": "uuid", "user_id": "uuid", "status": "confirmed" }`  
  - Validation:  
    - Dates must be valid & `check_out` > `check_in`.  
    - Property must exist and be available.

### Performance Criteria  
- Booking confirmation must complete within **<300ms** under normal load.  
- System should prevent race conditions (use transactions/locking).  
- Must scale to handle at least **500 bookings per second** during peak load.
